# Frontend Homework 20

I have finished my twentieth homework.

This one did not go well. 
This must be my spaghettiest code of all.

I had great plans to make everything reusable and DRY friendly,
but the more I started working, the more confused I became,
and due to lack of time pressure I made sure everything works but is not very reusable.

The design part is horrible too. To speed up the process, I imported Swedbank stylesheets from the style guide.
But that meant I had to use !important a bunch of times to fight the unknown styles that were lurking in the foreign sheet.

Visually and functionally the homework turned out fine, except the margin on the bottom that sometimes disappears.
But behind the scenes, it's utter chaos.
